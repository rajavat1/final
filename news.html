                <p>The competition heats up in the dapp arena as developers weigh Binance Smart Chain against Ethereum.
                    How do factors like scalability and transaction costs affect their decisions?</p>
                <p> The blockchain space is fiercely competitive, particularly when it comes to decentralized
                    applications (dapps).</p>
                <p>As of Feb. 2, according to data from DappRadar, a prominent analytics platform, Binance Chain (BNB)
                    is
                    at the forefront with 5,215 dapps and a user base exceeding 5.3 million unique active wallets (UAW)
                    over
                    the last 30 days.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Ethereum (ETH), on the other hand, holds the second position with 4,497 dApps, although its user base
                    of
                    approximately 1.36 million UAWs pales in comparison to Binance Chain. <a

                    <p>Kyrgyzstan-based crypto exchange Four Dragons revealed on its website that it fell victim to a
                        hacker attack on Feb. 22, leading to the loss of an undisclosed amount of crypto, reportedly
                        estimated to be worth around $100 million.</p>
                    <p>While the Bishkek-headquartered crypto exchange did not specify the stolen amount, it
                        acknowledged that the figure is “significant,” reassuring customers that operational activities
                        “continue as normal, despite the loss of some liquidity.” It is unclear how exactly the hackers
                        gained access allegedly to the exchange’s hot wallets. <a

                </div>

                <p>A security breach on the layer-1 blockchain Shido has led to a dramatic drop in its token value,
                    plunging by over 90% within a mere half-hour period. <br> The incident occurred after an exploit was
                    detected, with blockchain security firm PeckShield first reporting the anomaly on Feb. 29 through a
                    social media post on X..</p>

                <p>Further analysis by PeckShield revealed that the exploit involved the unauthorized transfer of the
                    blockchain’s Ethereum staking contract to a different address. The new owner subsequently modified
                    the contract with a concealed function that facilitated the withdrawal of staked tokens.</p>

                <p>Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand pits, and heard the clatter of
                    hoofs and the gride of wheels. I saw a lad trundling off the barrow of apples. And then, within
                    thirty yards of the pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a little black knot of
                    men, the foremost of whom was waving a white flag. <a

                <p>Gemini, the crypto startup owned by the Winklevoss twins, will have to return $1.1 billion to
                    customers who lost money in their partnership with the now-bankrupt crypto lender Genesis. </p>
                <p>
                    In a deal with the New York State Department of Financial Services, Gemini agreed to return the
                    funds lost by customers of its Earn program, in which users could loan their crypto to Genesis in
                    exchange for interest payments.
                </p>
                <p>“Gemini failed to conduct due diligence on an unregulated third party, later accused of massive
                    fraud, harming Earn customers who were suddenly unable to access their assets after Genesis Global
                    Capital experienced a financial meltdown,” DFS Superintendent Adrienne A.Harris said in a statement.
                    “Today’s settlement is a win for Earn customers, who have a right to the assets they entrusted to
                    Gemini.” <a

                <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed
                    into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could
                    see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was
                    hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. </p>

                <p>His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he
                    looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room
                    although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile
                    samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a
                    picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame.
                    It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff
                    that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the
                    window at the dull weather. <a

                <p>In the first two months of 2024, hacks across the Web3 space cost over $200 million, according to the
                    latest report by Immunefi, the blockchain cybersecurity platform protecting over $60 billion in
                    assets. In February, the losses amounted to nearly $70 million.</p>

                <p>According to the ‘Crypto Losses in the February 2024 Report,’ Web3 has lost $200,478,412 to hacks and
                    rug pulls in 2024 year-to-date.</p>
                <p>This is across 32 specific incidents in two months.</p>
                <p>The report stated that this represents a 15.4% increase when compared with the same period in 2023 at
                    $173,693,675.</p>

                <p>As its TVL rises, industry insiders say that DeFi is seeing increasing interest once again. DeFi is
                    robust and will continue to expand, the experts say, adding that 2024 will be an exciting year for
                    this growing sector.</p>

                <p>The total value locked in decentralized finance (DeFi) has surpassed $80 billion. It’s the first time
                    it has breached this threshold since the infamous fall of the Terra stablecoin nearly two years ago.
                </p>
                <p>According to DefiLlama, TVL is currently $90.113 billion. The last time it stood at this level was
                    May 2022.</p>
                <p><i>“The end of the Crypto Winter has led to an increase in investor confidence, which has filtered
                        through into the DeFi market. We expect this trend to continue, especially if the prices of
                        well-known crypto assets continue to rise.”</i></p>

                <p> An increase can be seen starting October 2023, picking up speed in January 2024.</p>

                <p> Between October 28, 2023, and February 28, 2024, TVL has increased by 108.3%. <a

                <p>The Ethereum network has recorded several gains in the last four months as decentralized activity
                    continues to rise amid institutional inflows.</p>

                <p> Data from DefiLlama shows an increasing number of transactions around decentralized finance (DeFi)
                    protocols causing a spike in values locked on most platforms.</p>

                <p> The Total Value Locked (TVL) on Ethereum is at $51.3 billion with protocols recording more inflows.
                    Lido, Maker, and EigenLayer remain the top three with $32 billion, $9.1 billion, and $9 billion
                    respectively in TVL.</p>

                <h5>Ethereum Dominates DeFi TVL</h5>
                <p>At press time, Ethereum dominates 60.03% of the market share while Tron and Binance Smart Chajn come
                    in next with 11.6% and 5.5%.</p>

                <p> While Ethereum grew 6% in the last seven days, Bitcoin posted a massive 30% jump in the same period.
                    This points to the wider market as a major reason for an increasing DeFi landscape. <a
